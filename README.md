Coding Test

Aim: To fix the code to allow a simulation of hard disks inside a box with hard walls which will show my understanding of git and basic object orientated programming in c++.

Steps:
1. Create system.h disk.h 
2. Fix hints on .cpp 
3. Compile to see any further errors 
4. Fix errors and make sure it runs
5. Create a makefile 
6. Neaten and improve if possible

Compile code:
g++ system.cpp disk.cpp main.cpp -o main
Run code:
./main

Compile code with Makefile:
make
Run code with Makefile:
./program

Git usage:
- I created .gitignore straight away
- I committed my code to git after each major edit with message of what i did
- I originally started using git add . and git commit -m "Message" but then I found the visual git repository section in vscode and found this was more efficient

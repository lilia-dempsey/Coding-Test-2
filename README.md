Coding Test

Aim: To fix the code to allow a simulation of hard disks inside a box with hard walls which will show my understanding of git and basic object orientated programming in c++.

Steps:
1. Create system.h disk.h 
2. Fix hints on .cpp 
3. Compile to see any further errors 
4. Fix errors and make sure it runs
5. Create a makefile 
6. Neaten and improve if possible

Compile code:
g++ system.cpp disk.cpp main.cpp -o main
